            <!--Adding Paragraph-->
            <p>Batman is a superhero who appears in American comic books published by DC Comics.
                Batman was created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, and debuted in the 27th 
                issue of the comic book Detective Comics on March 30, 1939. In the DC Universe continuity, 
                Batman is the alias of Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American playboy, philanthropist, and owner of
                Wayne Enterprises based in Gotham City. Kane, Finger, and future DC writers accompanied Batman 
                with supporting characters, including his sidekick Robin, allies Alfred Pennyworth and James Gordon, 
                and foes such as Catwoman, the Scarecrow, the Penguin, and his archenemy, the Joker. Batman's origin story 
                features him swearing vengeance against criminals after witnessing the murder of his parents Thomas and
                 Martha; he trains himself physically and intellectually, crafts a bat-inspired persona, and monitors
                the Gotham streets at night.Kane conceived Batman in early 1939 to capitalize on the popularity of
                 DC's Superman; although Kane frequently claimed sole creation credit, Finger substantially
                developed the concept from a generic superhero into something more bat-like. The character
                 received his own spin-off publication, Batman, in 1940. Batman was originally introduced
                as a ruthless vigilante who frequently killed or maimed criminals, but evolved into a
                character with a stringent moral code and strong sense of justice. Unlike most superheroes,
                 Batman does not possess any superpowers, instead relying on his intellect, fighting skills,
                  and wealth. The 1960s Batman television series used a camp aesthetic, which continued to be associated
                   with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his
                    darker roots in the 1970s and 1980s, culminating with the 1986 miniseries The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller.
                DC has featured Batman in many comic books, including comics published under its imprints such as Vertigo and Black Label.
                The longest-running Batman comic, Detective Comics, is the longest-running comic book in the United States. Batman is frequently
                depicted alongside other DC superheroes, such as Superman and Wonder Woman, as a member of organizations such as the Justice 
                League and the Outsiders. In addition to Bruce Wayne, other characters have taken on the Batman persona on different occasions,
                such as Jean-Paul Valley / Azrael in the 1993–1994 "Knightfall" story arc and Dick Grayson, the first Robin, for a three-year 
                period from 2009 to 2011. DC has also published comics featuring alternate versions of Batman, including the incarnation seen
                in The Dark Knight Returns and its successors, the incarnation from the Flashpoint (2011) event, and numerous interpretations 
                from Elseworlds stories.
